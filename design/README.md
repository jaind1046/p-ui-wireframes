Wireframes / Designs for the Management Portal on the Glasswall ICAP project.

## Wireframe
The wireframe is a powerpoint containing screenshots from an edited version of the prototype UI. 
At the moment, we don't have a Wireframing tool in place. 
The plan was to get [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) working to make the wireframe easier to update, that remains an option if time permits.

## Glasswall Design Resources
The files in this directory are resources from the Designers and artists that will help to keep the styling/colours/look and feel on brand with our other Glasswall productss.
